We do not plan on measuring these value, that is not to say we have ruled them out or will not in the future. The original plan was to measure PM2.5; however, as our team grows so do our projects.'))

For example we measure relative humidity so having temperature allows us to compare this humidity value with the recorded temperature value to determine a more accurate estimate of the volume of water in the atmosphere.'))

A: As of right now our focus is increasing the size of our PM2.5 sensor fleet. Pollen is a much larger particle than 2.5 microns so new sensors would need to be purchased. Additionally, due to the size of pollen it does not affect our data much.'))

A: There are lots of small things you can do to improve air quality in your area, but the biggest thing is awareness. Make sure people know it is a problem and encourage them to join you. Other steps would be to limit the amount you contribute to air pollution like using public transport or walking, trying not to use aerosols.'))

As for our work on the subject, we have just started scratching the surface and will grapple with the idea more in the coming months.'))
